# Hilarity Ensues
Hilarity Ensues is a movie information aggregator site with movie trailers. It is based on the Udacity (© 2011–2018 Udacity, Inc.) Movie Trailer Website project. ```fresh_tomatoes.py``` is a modified version of the Udacity file by the same name.

##### Pro tip:
Try saying, "and hilarity ensues" at the end of any movie summary for _unbelievably_ entertaining results.

## Usage
Type ```python entertainment_center.py``` (or ```python3 entertainment_center.py``` for python3)
 into the terminal to execute code, which will create ```hilarity_ensues.html```, then open the html file in the user's browser.

- "Director" class
- "TvShow" class
